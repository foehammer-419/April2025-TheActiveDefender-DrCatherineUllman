Notes from The Active Defender: Immersion in the Offensive Security Mindset


### Preface/Intro:

- Security belongs to everyone, even those who are infosec adjacent and everyone should be cognizant of the role they plany in securing their environment

- Don't just think defensively, but offensively as well

- Thesis: Active defenders are an alternative approach to cybersecurity defense, rather than passive/reactive Active Defenders engage in an offensive/attacker mindset to be more effective.
- Broadly: Defensive security teams are responsible for protecting systems against risks, ID'ing flaws, patching, and providing recodmmendations to increase the security posture of the org (i.e. network admins, devs, security engineers, etc...)
- Broadly: Offensive security teams are responsible for testing the defensive mechanisms put in place to protect an orgs systems from pen testing to full adversarial emulation.
- Challenges defensive secuirty teams face: Increasing cost of data breaches ($4.35 million, 2022) and time (avg time to discover/contain an attacker 277 days), compromised creds are the most popular intial attack method.
- Additional challenges: Teams are overwhlemed with work and there's not enough incentives in place for proper vuln management and other critical security tasks
